64 bit support
--------------

PPJoy now provides a driver for 64 bit Windows versions (e.g Vista x64 and Windows 7 x64). These drivers are test-signed and requires Windows to run in TEST MODE to load the drivers. Test signing mode can be enabled by running "BCDEDIT -SET TESTSIGNING ON" in an administrative command prompt.
